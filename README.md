# Understanding Volatile and Non-Volatile Storage

- Storage is a fundamental component that determines how data is retained and accessed. Storage can broadly be classified into two categories: volatile and non-volatile. This tutorial will explain the differences between these two types of storage.

### Volatile Versus Non-Volatile Storage

- There are two categories of storage: volatile and non-volatile.

## Volatile Storage

- If power is switched off or lost, any stored data in volatile storage is gone. Random Access Memory (RAM), the main memory in a computer system, is an example of volatile storage. The computer uses RAM as temporary storage while it is operating because RAM is FAST—much faster than non-volatile storage.

- Random-access memory is a form of computer data storage that stores data and machine code currently being used. A RAM device allows data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory. In contrast, with other direct-access data storage media such as hard disks, CD-RWs, DVD-RWs, and the older magnetic tapes and drum memory, the time required to read and write data items varies significantly depending on their physical locations on the recording medium, due to mechanical limitations such as media rotation speeds and arm movement.

### Examples of Volatile Storage

- RAM (Random Access Memory): Used for temporary data storage while programs are running.

- Cache Memory: Stores frequently accessed data to speed up processes.

### Key Characteristics of Volatile Storage

- High speed

- Temporary data retention

- Requires constant power

## Non-Volatile Storage

- Non-volatile storage retains data even after turning off or losing power. It is used for long-term data storage. Examples include magnetic tapes, hard disks, optical disks (CD, DVD, Blu-Ray), and solid-state drives (SSDs). Non-volatile storage tends to be more inexpensive than volatile storage and has slower access and transfer speeds.

### Even non-volatile storage eventually loses the data stored on it. Environmental factors, mechanical failure, and chemical degradation can affect its lifespan. Here are some estimated lifespans:

#### Estimated Lifespan

##### Magnetic tapes

- Up to 10 years

##### Nintendo cartridge

- 10–20 years

##### Floppy disk

- 10–20 years

##### CDs and DVDs

- 5–10 unrecorded, 2–5 recorded

##### Blu-ray

- Not certain, probably 2–5 years

##### M-Disc

- 1,000 years (theoretically)

##### Flash storage

- 5–10 years or more (depends on write cycles)

#### Examples of Non-Volatile Storage

- HDD (Hard Disk Drive): A traditional storage device for large amounts of data.

- SSD (Solid State Drive): A faster, more reliable storage device than HDDs.

- Flash Drives and Memory Cards: Portable storage options.

- Optical Discs (CD/DVD): Used for media storage.

### Key Characteristics of Non-Volatile Storage

- Retains data without power

- Used for long-term storage

- Slower compared to volatile storage

- Factors Impacting Data Longevity

##### The longevity of data depends on storage conditions and media type:

- Magnetic disks are affected by magnetic fields.

- Optical disks are affected by light and heat.

- Flash storage wears out with repeated write cycles.

#### Scientists are working on long-term storage solutions. For example:

- Millenniata introduced ceramic-based optical discs that theoretically last 1,000 years.

- The University of Southampton developed "five-dimensional" glass discs that can store data for up to 13.8 billion years.
